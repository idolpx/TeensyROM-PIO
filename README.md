# TeensyROM PIO
**ROM emulator, super fast loader, MIDI Host/Device and Internet interface cartridge for the Commodore 64 & 128, based on the Teensy 4.1**

*Design by Travis S/Sensorium ([e-mail](mailto:travis@sensoriumembedded.com))* 

The intent of this repo is to convert the project to be used with Visual Studio Code & PlatformIO instead of the Arduino IDE.
I'm also using this project to get familiar with the TeensyROM codebase.
Please see the original repo for more details.
